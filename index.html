				The demonstration video shows a couple words chosen from the list of about 2300 answers and the program attempting to guess them by randomly picking from the list of about 13000 valid words. The time.sleep() function was used so that we may have an easier time seeing the output. As the list of possible words that meet the conditions continues to decrease, the program's chances of guessing the answer increases.<br><br>
				The source code and DataFrames containing the recorded info can be found <b>here</b>.<br><br>
				Information is also printed to the terminal:<br>
				<ul class = "shift">
					<li>Bits of information - The number of times we halved the list of possibilities</li><br>
					<li>Number of possibilites left - How many words that fit the previously accumulated conditions</li><br>
					<li>Chances of guessing correctly - Chance of guessing correctly if we blindly choose from the list of possibilities</li>

				It is unlikely to be able to guess a word within 2 guesses. Many of these guesses can be considered flukes which explains why there are only 18 of them out of over 2300 guesses. Since a plot of a singular point of data for guesses made in 2 attempts would be a bit meaningless, the data will be summarized shortly below. <br><br>
				<b>Bits of information collected</b>
				<ul class = "shift">
					<li>Attempt 1 Avg: 9.609 bits</li>
					<li>Attempt 1 Max: 13.661</li>
					<li>Attempt 1 Min: 2.526</li>
				</ul><br>
				<b>Number of possibilities left</b>
				<ul class = "shift">
					<li>Attempt 1 Avg: 216.33 words</li>
					<li>Attempt 1 Max: 2249 words</li>
					<li>Attempt 1 Min: 1</li>
				</ul><br>
				<b>Chances of guessing correctly</b>
				<ul class = "shift">
					<li>Attempt 1 Avg: 30.27 %</li>
					<li>Attempt 1 Max: 100 %</li>
					<li>Attempt 1 Min: 0.044 %</li>
