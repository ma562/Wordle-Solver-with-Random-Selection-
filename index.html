				The demonstration video shows a couple words chosen from the list of about 2300 answers and the program attempting to guess them by randomly picking from the list of about 13000 valid words. The time.sleep() function was used so that we may have an easier time seeing the output. As the list of possible words that meet the conditions continues to decrease, the program's chances of guessing the answer increases.<br><br>
				Information is also printed to the terminal:<br>
				<ul class = "shift">
					<li>Bits of information - The number of times we halved the list of possibilities</li><br>
					<li>Number of possibilites left - How many words that fit the previously accumulated conditions</li><br>
					<li>Chances of guessing correctly - Chance of guessing correctly if we blindly choose from the list of possibilities</li>
